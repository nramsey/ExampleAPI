# Pre-requisites
This is a project .Net Core 3.1 project, so you will need the runtime which can be downloaded from here:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1

# Debugging from Visual Studio
The easiest way to debug the program locally for test is to run it from within visual studio in debug mode

# Running from the Command line
From within the project folder run the command
`dotnet run .\AdvantageEdgeAPI`
This will run the API on https://localhost:5001. You will receie a security risk for the https domain, it is okay to ignore this.

# Swagger
The root directory when running the API will display a Swagger API for debugging and documentation of the API
